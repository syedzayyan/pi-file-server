# pi-file-server

It's not necessarily a raspberry pi server. It can run anywhere. The backend is written in Golang. Mainly because I wanted to experiment with Golang and did not want to build a "tutorial" project. So here's me experimenting. The frontend is written is written in svelte as it has a small footprint.

Here's some pictures of the frontend.

Authentication does not work yet. I thinking of adding encrypted folders but that's a work-in-progress.
